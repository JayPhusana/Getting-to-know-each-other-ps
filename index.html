<h2 class="city">Introduction</h2>
<p>I'm a junior here at Lewis, I lives on campus, and I double major in Aviation administration and Business administration. I was born in Khon Kean, Thailand. I moved to the states around 2016. In the beginning, I lived in Texas, then I moved to Illinois for college. I did some programing in highschool, C++ to be specific. Didn't quite enjoy it, but I think it would be very benefitial for me in the future.</p>
